                  into and form a part of the Agreement. For each Order Form,

                  Upon payment of any applicable fees set forth in each Order

                  moshn otherwise provides additional services beyond those

                  versions or releases of the Services at any time in its sole
                  discretion; provided that moshn shall use commercially

                  purposes of this Agreement, including any copies and

                  distributed or otherwise provided to Customer hereunder
                  (including without limitation any software identified on an
                  Order Form) shall be deemed a part of the “Services” and

                  No rights or licenses are granted except as expressly and
                  unambiguously set forth in this Agreement. Customer may (but
                  is not obligated to) provide suggestions, comments or other
                  feedback to moshn with respect to the Service (“Feedback”).
                  Feedback, even if designated as confidential by Customer,
                  shall not create any confidentiality obligation for moshn
                  notwithstanding anything else. moshn acknowledges and agrees
                  that all Feedback is provided “AS IS” and without warranty of
                  any kind. Customer shall, and hereby does, grant to moshn a

                  sublicensable, royalty-free, fully paid up license to use and
                  exploit the Feedback for any purpose. Nothing in this
                  Agreement will impair moshn’s right to develop, acquire,
                  license, market, promote or distribute products, software or
                  technologies that perform the same or similar functions as, or
                  otherwise compete with any products, software or technologies

                  moshn may use Customer’s name and logo in client listings and

                  Customer shall pay moshn fees for the Service as set forth in
                  each Order Form (“Service Fees”). Unless otherwise specified
                  in an Order Form, all Service Fees shall be invoiced (i)
                  monthly and (ii) in advance, and all invoices issued under
                  this Agreement are to be paid in U.S. dollars at least five
                  (5) business days before the start of each month. Past due
                  invoices are subject to interest on any outstanding balance of
                  the lesser of 1.5% per month or the maximum amount permitted
                  by law. Customer shall be responsible for all taxes associated
                  with Service (excluding taxes based on moshn’s net income).
                  All Service Fees paid are non-refundable and are not subject

                  set forth on an Order Form, then (x) moshn shall invoice
                  Customer for such additional users or usage at the overage
                  rates set forth on the Order Form (or if no overage rates are
                  set forth on the Order Form, at moshn’s then-current standard
                  overage rates for such usage), in each case on a pro-rata
                  basis from the first date of such excess usage through the end
                  of the Order Form Initial Term or then-current Order Form

                  Customer has given access to the Service, even if Customer did
                  not authorize such use. Customer agrees and acknowledges that
                  Customer Data may be irretrievably deleted if Customer’s
                  account is ninety (90) days or more delinquent.
                  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Customer
                  acknowledges and agrees that moshn may (i) internally use and
                  modify (but not disclose) Customer Data for the purposes of
                  (A) providing the Service to Customer and (B) generating
                  Aggregated Anonymous Data (as defined below), and (ii) freely
                  use and make available Aggregated Anonymous Data for moshn’s
                  business purposes (including without limitation, for purposes
                  of improving, testing, operating, promoting and marketing
                  moshn’s products and services). “Aggregated Anonymous Data”
                  means data submitted to, collected by, or generated by moshn
                  in connection with Customers’ use of the Service, but only in
                  aggregate, anonymized form which can in no way be linked
                  specifically to Customer.

                  This Agreement shall commence upon the date of the first Order
                  Form, and, unless earlier terminated in accordance herewith,
                  shall last until the expiration of all Order Form Terms. For
                  each Order Form, unless otherwise specified therein, the
                  “Order Form Term” shall begin as of the effective date set
                  forth on such Order Form, and unless earlier terminated as set
                  forth herein, (x) shall continue for the initial term
                  specified on such Order Form (provided that if no initial term
                  is specified, such initial term shall be deemed to be for
                  three (3) months) (the “Order Form Initial Term”), and (y)
                  following the Order Form Initial Term, shall automatically
                  renew for additional successive periods of equal duration to
                  the Order Form Initial Term (each, a “Order Form Renewal
                  Term”) unless either party notifies the other party of such
                  party’s intention not to renew no later than thirty (30) days
                  prior to the expiration of the Order Form Initial Term or
                  then-current Order Form Renewal Term, as applicable. In the
                  event of a material breach of this Agreement by either party,
                  the non-breaching party may terminate this Agreement by
                  providing written notice to the breaching party, provided that
                  the breaching party does not materially cure such breach
                  within thirty (30) days of receipt of such notice. Without
                  limiting the foregoing, moshn may suspend or limit Customer’s
                  access to or use of the Service if (i) Customer’s account is
                  more than sixty (60) days past due, or (ii) Customer’s use of
                  the Service results in (or is reasonably likely to result in)
                  damage to or material degradation of the Service which
                  interferes with moshn’s ability to provide access to the
                  Service to other customers; provided that in the case of
                  subsection (ii): (a) moshn shall use reasonable good faith
                  efforts to work with Customer to resolve or mitigate the
                  damage or degradation in order to resolve the issue without
                  resorting to suspension or limitation; (b) prior to any such
                  suspension or limitation, moshn shall use commercially
                  reasonable efforts to provide notice to Customer describing
                  the nature of the damage or degradation; and (c) moshn shall
                  reinstate Customer’s use of or access to the Service, as
                  applicable, if Customer remediates the issue within thirty
                  (30) days of receipt of such notice. All provisions of this
                  Agreement which by their nature should survive termination
                  shall survive termination, including, without limitation,
                  accrued payment obligations, ownership provisions, warranty
                  disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability. In the
                  case of expiration or termination of this Agreement, upon
                  request by Customer made before, or within [thirty (30)] days
                  after, the effective date of expiration or termination, moshn
                  shall make available to Customer a complete download of all
                  Customer Data in a file or database format in moshn’s
                  discretion. For clarity, any services provided by moshn to
                  Customer, including the data export set out above, and any
                  assistance in exporting the Customer Data, shall be billable
                  at moshn’s standard rates then in effect.

                  unaffiliated third party (including reasonable attorneys’
                  fees) (“Losses”), that arise from or relate to any claim that
                  (i) the Customer Data or Customer’s use of the Service (in the
                  case of Customer as Indemnitor), or (ii) the Service (in the

                  misappropriates any third party intellectual property or
                  proprietary right. Each Indemnitor’s indemnification

                  providing the Indemnitor with: (i) prompt written notice of
                  any claim (provided that a failure to provide such notice
                  shall only relieve the Indemnitor of its indemnity obligations
                  if the Indemnitor is materially prejudiced by such failure);
                  (ii) the option to assume sole control over the defense and
                  settlement of any claim (provided that the Indemnitee may
                  participate in such defense and settlement at its own
                  expense); and (iii) reasonable information and assistance in
                  connection with such defense and settlement (at the
                  Indemnitor’s expense). The foregoing obligations of moshn do

                  after being informed of modifications that would have avoided
                  the alleged infringement, or (vi) Customer’s use of the

                  Customer and moshn with respect thereto. The Agreement shall
                  be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
                  the State of California, excluding its conflicts of law rules,
                  and the parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in
                  the state and federal courts located in San Francisco,

                  received, if personally delivered or sent by certified or

                  provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless in
                  writing and signed by the waiving party. Except for payment
                  obligations, neither party shall be liable for any failure to

                  governmental body or authority, civil or military, including
                  the orders and judgments of courts. Neither party may assign
                  any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the other
                  party’s consent; provided that (i) either party may assign all
                  of its rights and obligations hereunder without such consent
                  to a successor-in-interest in connection with a sale of
                  substantially all of such party’s business relating to this
                  Agreement, and (ii) moshn may utilize subcontractors in the
                  performance of its obligations hereunder. No agency,
                  partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship is
                  created as a result of this Agreement and neither party has
                  any authority of any kind to bind the other in any respect. In

                  Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover
                  costs and attorneys’ fees. If any provision of this Agreement
                  is held to be unenforceable for any reason, such provision
                  shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
                  enforceable. The failure of either party to act with respect
                  to a breach of this Agreement by the other party shall not
                  constitute a waiver and shall not limit such party’s rights
                  with respect to such breach or any subsequent breaches.
