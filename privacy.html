              <p>
                This policy applies to all moshn mobility users, including
                Owners and Drivers and all moshn mobility platforms and
                services, including our apps, websites, features, and other
                services (The “moshn mobility Platform”). Your use of the moshn
                mobility Platform is also subject to the moshn mobility service
                terms.
              </p>

                Information We Collect
              </h2>
              <p>
                When you use the moshn mobility Platform, we collect the
                information you provide, usage information, and information
                about your device. We also collect information about you from
                other sources like third party services, and optional programs
                in which you participate, which we may combine with other
                information we have about you. Here are the types of information
                we collect about you:
              </p>
              <h3>
                A. Information You Provide to Us
              </h3>
              <p>
                Account Registration. When you create an account with moshn
                mobility, we collect the information you provide us, such as
                your name, email address, phone number. You may choose to share
                additional info with us, like your photo or saved addresses
                (e.g., home or work), and set up other preferences such as your
                preferred name.
              </p>
              <p>
                Driver Information. Once you subscribe to our vehicles, we will
                collect the information you provide in your application,
                including your name, email address, phone number, birth date,
                profile photo, physical address, driver’s license information,
                vehicle information, and car insurance information. We may need
                additional information from you at some point after you become a
                customer, including information to confirm your identity (like a
                photo).
              </p>
              <p>
                Communications. When you contact us or we contact you, we
                collect any information that you provide, including the contents
                of the messages or attachments you send us.

                B. Information We Collect When You Use the moshn mobility

              </h3>
              <p>
                Location Information. The moshn mobility Platform collects
                location information (including GPS and WiFi data) differently
                depending on your moshn mobility app settings and role as an
                Owner or a Driver:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Owners: We collect your device’s precise location when you
                  open and use the moshn mobility app, including while the app
                  is running in the background from the time you request a ride
                  until it ends. moshn mobility also tracks the precise location
                  of the moshn owned vehicles you subscribe to at all times.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Drivers: We collect your device’s precise location when you
                  open and use the app, including while the app is running in
                  the background when it is in driver mode. We also collect
                  information on the precise location and route of the moshn
                  vehicles or vehicles subscribed to the moshn service that you
                  drive.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Usage Information. We collect information about your use of the
                moshn mobility Platform, including driving information like the
                date, time, destination, distance and route. We also collect
                information about your interactions with the moshn mobility
                Platform like our apps and websites, including the pages and
                content you view and the dates and times of your use.
              </p>
              <p>
                Device Information. We may collect information about the devices
                you use to access the moshn mobility Platform, including device
                model, IP address, type of browser, version of operating system,
                identity of carrier and manufacturer, radio type (such as 4G),
                preferences and settings (such as preferred language),
                application installations, device identifiers, advertising
                identifiers, and push notification tokens.
              </p>
              <p>
                Communications Between Riders and Drivers. We may choose to use
                a third party to facilitate phone calls and text messages
                between Owners and Drivers without sharing either party’s actual
                phone number with the other. But while we use a third party to
                provide the communication service, we collect information about
                these communications, including the participants’ phone numbers,
                the date and time, and the contents of SMS messages.
              </p>
              <p>
                Address Book Contacts. You may set your device permissions to
                grant moshn mobility access to your contact lists and direct
                moshn mobility to access your contact list, for example to help
                you refer friends to moshn mobility. If you do this, we will
                access and store the names and contact information of the people
                in your address book.
              </p>
              <p>
                Cookies, Analytics, and Third Party Technologies. We collect
                information through the use of “cookies”, tracking pixels, data
                analytics tools like Google Analytics, SDKs, and other third
                party technologies to understand how you navigate through the
                moshn mobility Platform and interact with moshn mobility
                advertisements, to make your moshn mobility experience safer, to
                learn what content is popular, to improve your site experience,
                to serve you better ads on other sites, and to save your
                preferences. Cookies are small text files that web servers place
                on your device; they are designed to store basic information and
                to help websites and apps recognize your browser. We may use
                both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie
                disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie
                remains after you close your browser and may be accessed every
                time you use the moshn mobility Platform.
